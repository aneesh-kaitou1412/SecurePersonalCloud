-Put comments for all the API functions and Function overrides

File Sharing:
Make primary_owner as single pk field
Rename owner to sharers
Others remain same
Sharing criterions:
View and Update can be done by sharers
( get put methods : in status correspond to in server only and download it, in client and server modified and upload it back)
Delete on server only by primary_owner
( delete method : in status correspond to in server only and delete it )
M2:
only owners as before, everyone can delete and update
easier to implement now


-Always post data in string representation of base64 encoded format
-Read file in rb -> b64encode(<bytearray>) //needs bytes like object -> en = str(en) -> en = en[2:-1]
 -> Then apply encryption scheme (must be string to string)-> then send to database
-Decoding can be done to str repr of b64 string or byte form of b64 string in python!
-Decoding :
 in cli: get encoded string -> apply decryption algo (string to string ) -> gives b64 string repr -> b6decode
    -> get bytes form of file -> wb+ write to file (+ to replace)
 in web client : get encoded string -> apply decryption algo (string to string ) -> gives b64 string repr
    -> need this only for embed!!

In view and Webpage : if no of owners > 1 then put a mark beside it! Shared file/folder

WISHLIST : allowing to add files / folders from webpage
