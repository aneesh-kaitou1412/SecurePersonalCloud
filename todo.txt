-Put comments for all the API functions and Function overrides

File Sharing:
only owners as before, everyone can delete and update
easier to implement now


-Always post data in string representation of base64 encoded format
-Read file in rb -> b64encode(<bytearray>) //needs bytes like object -> en = str(en) -> en = en[2:-1]
 -> Then apply encryption scheme (must be string to string)-> then send to database
-Decoding can be done to str repr of b64 string or byte form of b64 string in python!
-Decoding :
 in cli: get encoded string -> apply decryption algo (string to string ) -> gives b64 string repr -> b6decode
    -> get bytes form of file -> wb+ write to file (+ to replace)
 in web client : get encoded string -> apply decryption algo (string to string ) -> gives b64 string repr
    -> need this only for embed!!

In view and Webpage :
-if no of owners > 1 then put a mark beside it! Shared file/folder
-put an embed tag and use file_type also for it

WISHLIST : allowing to add files / folders from webpage
